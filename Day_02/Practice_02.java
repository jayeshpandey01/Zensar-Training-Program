Keywords in java:
1. abstract: It is a non-access modifier applicable for classes and methods. It is used to achieve abstraction in Java. An abstract class can't be instantiated, and it needs subclasses to provide implementations for its abstract methods. An abstract method is a method without a body.

4. break: It is used to terminate a loop or switch statement.
5. byte: It is a data type that can store whole numbers from -128 to 127.
6. case: It is used in switch statements to specify different code blocks.
7. catch: It is used to handle exceptions in Java.

9. class: It is used to declare a class in Java.
10. continue: It is used to skip the current iteration of a loop.
